### An example data product created for my university course.

It depends on the following packages:
  - **json**
  - **time**
  - **requests**
  - **matplotlib**  
 
If python complains about any missing packages, simply install them and try running *main.py* again.  
To run it, simply clone this repo and start *main.py.*
